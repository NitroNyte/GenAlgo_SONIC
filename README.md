# GenAlgo_SONIC
A Genetic algorithm that revolves around the game Sonic The Hedgehog. This algorithm is used to create and learn how to play the game.
The algorithm was created by me with help from a friend (If interested about his projects here is his github:https://github.com/simplicity-load).
To run this you will need gym-retro and all ther other respective packages.
Hopefully you will enjoy it!
